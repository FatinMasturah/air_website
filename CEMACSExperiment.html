For this experiment, we constructed an instrumented platform in the tropical coastal 
location at the Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies (CEMACS) of Universiti Sains Malaysia.

Atmosphere-sea flux exchanges drive the weather and climate engines and the 
global cabon-moisture cycle. Although anthropogenic carbon emissions have increased significantly 
for the past half-century, scientists also found that the oceans and seas have more than 
doubled its absorption of carbon. Due to climate change, climate models predict an increase
in sea surface temperature, which could decrease the carbon uptakes of the ocean and sea. 
Through direct measurements of carbon and moisture fluxes, we can determine the mechanism 
responsible for these uptakes, critical in improving the climate models. <br />
<br />
We provide updated plots of half-hourly 24-hour flux and weather data in the <a class="underline"
