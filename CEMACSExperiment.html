Atmosphere-sea flux exchanges power the weather and climate engines and the 
global cabon-moisture cycle. Though carbon emissions have increased significantly 
for the past half-century, scientists found that the sea carbon uptake have
more than doubled. However, climate models predict a reduction in the sea carbon 
uptake due to increased sea surface temperature caused by climate change. 
Direct carbon and moisture flux measurments can reveal the mechanism 
responsible for these uptakes, which is critical in improving the climate 
models. <br />
